## Introduction

This project demonstrates a countdown script written in JavaScript that displays messages from 10 to 1 and finally wishes "Happy Independence Day!" on a webpage. The code uses a callback hell structure with nested `setTimeout` calls.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

2. Observe the countdown messages appearing in a single line on the webpage.

## How it Works

The JavaScript code in `index.html` uses nested `setTimeout` calls to create a callback hell structure. Each callback updates the content of a specific HTML element, creating the countdown effect. The last callback displays the final message "Happy Independence Day!".
